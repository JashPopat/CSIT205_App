App: Bookie - The Score Viewing and Sports Booking Application
Creators: Jash Popat, Viraj Sheth, Abhyuday Singh
Due Date: Mar 22, 2023

To create Bookie, we will be adding in several components that work together to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for users. These components include:

	1. User interface: The user interface is the primary means by which users interact with the app. The screens (as demonstrated in our Low Fidelity Prototype), buttons (to move around the different pages), forms (to book the sport of choice), and other visual elements (scoreboards, graphics, etc) will allow users to book sports facilities, view bookings and matches and manage their accounts.

	2. Booking engine: The booking engine will be the core of the app and will handle the actual process of making a booking. Whether it is managing the sports facility availability or handling processing and confirmation of the booking with the user, the engine will do it all.

	3. Availability calendar: The availability calendar is a visual representation of when sports facilities are available for booking and what games will be aired when. It will allow the users to select a date and time that works for them and see all the relevant information.

	4. Notifications: Notifications are an essential component of any sports booking app. With these, we will help in keeping the users informed of the status of their bookings, remind them of upcoming bookings, and alert them about any changes or cancellations. On top of them, we can use notifications to inform users about highlights of an event and match updates.

	5. Authentication and authorization: Each student must have an account to access information about ongoing games and to book their sports. This component manages the login and authentication process for users and ensures that only authorized users have access to the app's features and data.

	6. Admin dashboard: This component will provide an interface for the app's administrators to manage aspects like viewing bookings, updating facilities, adding or removing users and other aspects of the app. It will also include analytics and reporting features.
